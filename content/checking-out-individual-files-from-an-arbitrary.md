<p>Just a quick tip.</p>

<p>Do you want to look at a file in a different branch where tests are passing to see if the problem is in that file? Or maybe you want to rollback a change in git to a particular previous version?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy, once you have the commit SHA:</p>

<pre><code>git checkout &lt;sha&gt; /path/to/file.rb
</code></pre>

<p>Done!</p>

<p>⦂∀</p>
