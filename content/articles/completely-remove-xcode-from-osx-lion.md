<p>First you want to try running this:</p>

<pre><code>sudo /Developer/Library/uninstall-devtools -mode=all
sudo rm -rf /Developer
</code></pre>

<p>Repeat above for any other directories beginning with <code>Developer</code> in your root directory. For some reason I had two: <code>Developer</code> and <code>Developer-3.2.6</code>.</p>

<p>Some systems may have a <code>/Library/Developer/Shared</code> directory also, so make sure you check for that directory, it will have its own <code>uninstall-devtools</code> script.</p>

<p>After that delete the install app (this will make sure the AppStore knows its been uninstalled):</p>

<pre><code>sudo rm -rf /Applications/Install Xcode.app
</code></pre>

<p>Some people may also find deleting the AppStore cache helps, but <strong>only</strong> do this if the above doesn&rsquo;t work, remember to replace &ldquo;your username&rdquo; with the actual directory name:</p>

<pre><code>sudo rm -rf /Library/Caches
sudo rm -rf /User/your username/Library/Caches/com.apple.appstore
</code></pre>

<p>Done!</p>

<p>And let me know if you have any other tips.</p>
