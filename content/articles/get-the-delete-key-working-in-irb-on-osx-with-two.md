<aside><strong>EDIT:</strong> <em>I mean forward-delete not backspace. This is function+delete on my MacBook and the standard delete key in the navigation cluster on my shiny <a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-ultimate/" target="_blank">Das Keyboard</a>.</em></aside>

<p>Its been driving me nuts. The delete key doesn&rsquo;t work in IRB (or <a href="https://github.com/pry/pry#readme" target="_blank">Pry</a>) on OSX!</p>

<p>Anyway, today I took a couple of minutes and tried this:</p>

<pre><code>brew install readline
rvm install 1.9.2  --with-readline-dir=/usr/local/Cellar/readline/6.2.1
</code></pre>

<p>It works now. That&rsquo;s seriously all I had to do. No patching required!</p>

<p>This is like the day I got the number pad working in all of Vim on OSX. And that was a wonderful day!</p>

<p>Its possible that <a href="http://beginrescueend.com/packages/readline/" target="_blank">installing readline with rvm</a> might have the same effect, but I wanted readline to be readily available to other applications I installed as well.</p>

Use whatever the current version of readline is for you. Do `ls /usr/local/Cellar/readline/` to find it.
