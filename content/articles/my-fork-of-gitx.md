GitX
</a></aside>

This codebase combines a lot of awesome features from several forks of
GitX and I use it almost every day. There’s a binary build in the
download section packaged up in a DMG and ready to play with.

Key features:

- Auto-reloading of repos when they change
- File history
- Blame
- Syntax hilighting of files

In addition to the features of GitX that have been around a while:

- Browsable file hierarchies as they existed per commit
- Graphical branching and commit history
- Merge local and remote branches
- Add and fetch remote repositories
- Partial-file (patch level) staging and discarding
- Diff between commits, branches, repos, staged and unstaged files
- Write commit messages and commit changes

Keep in mind that I’m not an Objective-C developer, and I only made
minor tweaks and judgement calls on what features to keep between forks
when I merged them. The work here is derived from half a dozen forks and
the work of many more developers.

There’s constantly more work being done on GitX by tons of people, so
check out what they’re doing on [Github](https://github.com/acook/gitx/network)!
