# Making your Life Easier by Throwing Money at the Problem

<p>Okay, first off, throwing money at your problems isn&rsquo;t usually the solution (unless your problems are unpaid bills, then its very effective).</p>

<p>However, its surprising how much difference a little thing here and there can make.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m talking of course about power cables.</p>

#### &ldquo;Power cables?!&rdquo;

<p>Right. Power cables. I have a laptop I use for work, it&rsquo;s a great little shiny 13&quot; 2.7ghz <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/specs-13inch.html" title="I'm seriously considering getting an SSD" target="_blank">MacBook Pro</a>. I also use Portland&rsquo;s rather unpredictable public transit system. So in the morning when my brain is still <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-on_self-test" title="otherwise known as Power On Self Test" target="_blank">POSTing</a>, I try to keep my morning routine as streamlined as possible.</p>

<p>For some reason the one thing that that seemed to slow me down was winding up my laptop cable.</p>

<p>Realistically, there&rsquo;s been a handful of times I&rsquo;ve left home or work without it, but there was one time back in 2008..</p>

<p>I was going on a trip to Australia, I brought only my phone (which I knew would be useless once I got there) and my little first-gen Asus EeePc. I land in LA to switch planes, but due to delays leaving O'Hare, the flight had left before I ever arrived. So I was stranded in LA. I pull out my Eee and record a silly little video blog, and get online for a while. Then I realized the horrible truth.. I&rsquo;d left my dammed power cable somewhere.</p>

<p>It turned out it&rsquo;d fallen out of my bag in a friend&rsquo;s car on the way to the airport. I was basically without internet, computer or phone for a week in a foreign country. Hardly the end of the world, but I&rsquo;ve been a bit paranoid about power cables ever since.</p>

<p>So recently due to a cable issue, one of my coworkers picked up an additional cable for me, and I found another one floating around. So now I have one cable at home, one at my desk at work, and one (glitchy) cable in my bag just in case.</p>

<p>Now my mornings and running to catch my bus after committing that last change are easier. One less thing to worry about.</p>

<p>Going to the Apple store they will cost you around $80. Ouch. You can get them for less than $20 if you look though, I just looked on Google Shopping, new and used ones there.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s just a little something I&rsquo;ve found helps me.
What is something you could do to streamline your mornings?</p>
