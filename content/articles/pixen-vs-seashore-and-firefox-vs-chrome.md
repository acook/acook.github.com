<p>So I was just playing with some ideas to create my own Tumblr theme, an I noticed a few differences between the above mentioned applications.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t a debate about which is better, this is just a couple of oddities I&rsquo;ve noticed.</p>

<h1><a href="http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/13363/pixen" target="_blank">Pixen</a> vs <a href="http://seashore.sourceforge.net/The_Seashore_Project/About.html" target="_blank">Seashore</a></h1>

<p>These are <em>very</em> different applications and I&rsquo;m using them for very specific tasks, which one may be better suited for than the other.</p>

<h2>Pixen</h2>

<ul><li>When you save a GIF, it automatically assumes an alpha channel.</li>
<li>Resizing your canvas is simple: <code>Edit/Resize Canvas...</code> and enter your dimensions</li>
</ul><h2>Seashore</h2>

<ul><li>No alpha channel when you save a GIF. </li>
<li>Even when the background of your image is transparent. </li>
<li>In fact I don&rsquo;t see an option to save GIFs with an alpha channel at all. (!?)</li>
<li>After some hunting and experimenting I discovered how to resize my canvas: <code>Image/Image Boundaries...</code></li>
<li>You can&rsquo;t just set your dimensions, you have to tell it <em>where</em> to expand/contract.</li>
<li>That&rsquo;s more powerful, its great, but it doesn&rsquo;t explain that or warn you if you just enter your dimensions and hit &ldquo;Set&rdquo;. Nothing happens at all.</li>
</ul><h2>My Opinion</h2>

<p>Seashore is clearly a more stable and powerful application, Pixen is designed for pixel drawing and animation, that&rsquo;s about it. The advantage to Pixen&rsquo;s narrow mindset is that they made it intuitive to use and have sane defaults.</p>

<p>This is a lesson to me, and I must remember it. And the lesson is in simplicity and what we can learn from it.</p>

<h1><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/fx/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> vs <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Chrome</a></h1>

<p>This is very zoomed in, because I&rsquo;m working with pixels here.</p>

<h2>Firefox PNG and Font Rendering</h2>

<h2>Chrome PNG and Font Rendering</h2>

<p><img src="http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpxx7cAhHV1qetbyr.png" alt=""/></p>

<h2>My Opinion</h2>

<p>Judgement call? Firefox beats the pants off of Chrome as far as repeating image rendering. It treats the entire element as a single image and dithers accordingly. That&rsquo;s a fantastic way to do it. You can actually just barely see the dividing line between the top and bottom of the Firefox image, that&rsquo;s because those are two different <code>p</code>-tags.</p>

<p>The font rendering is pretty similar, but again I have to give it to Firefox here. At huge scales, their fonts look cleaner.</p>

<p>At normal scales I can&rsquo;t consciously tell the difference between the image nor font rendering. But still, I&rsquo;d like to see those features implemented in Chrome.</p>

<p>I use both browsers regularly, and strongly prefer Chrome, but there&rsquo;s still certainly things to be learned from other browsers.</p>
