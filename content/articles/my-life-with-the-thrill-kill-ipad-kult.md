# My Life with the
# Thrill Kill iPad Kult

<p>So I&rsquo;m going to spend the next week or so with an iPad2 and try to use it wherever I can.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there&rsquo;s no official Tumblr app for iPad, only the iPhone one, and that is not really adequate. So I&rsquo;ll see what else there is and try that out.</p>

<p>Of note is that I&rsquo;ve never had an iTunes/Apple account before. I&rsquo;m very annoyed that they force you to supply credit card information for it, which is one of the reasons why I never did before.</p>

<p>So far I&rsquo;ve grabbed some eBooks, a couple of games, watched some stuff on Netflix, and realized how annoying it is to not have a decent chat client, and on top of that having no meaningful multitasking.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll see what the next week holds..</p>
