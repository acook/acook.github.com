Are you Living in a Cave?
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too many startup people act like they are sitting in a cave inventing
something utterly new.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Chances are, they’re not.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 I constantly find myself amazed when I recommend a blog post, or a
tactic to someone and they are like “Oh, that’s just what I need! I
never thought to search for that.” Even more amazing is when someone
labors day and night trying to figure out how to make a successful app
yet has never heard of something like a/b testing.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 I feel like these people must be living in caves.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 One of the fun parts of the University of Chicago was that we
constantly had to do research. This, plus being a programmer, entirely
convinced me of the following:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 “Whatever I am doing, a lot of other people have probably also tried
to do it. Some of them have probably been way more successful than I
have been so far. Some of them have probably written books or blog
posts about how they successfully did what I am doing now. I can find
these books and blog posts on Google and then apply what they say.”
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 The four sentences above are somehow not common knowledge, in my
experience. I have no idea why.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google, APIs, books, blogs, and most importantly &lt;em&gt;other people&lt;/em&gt; are my
external memory and processing units. We are all part of the same
beowulf cluster! Use the fantastic abilities of the other nodes around
you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⦂∀&lt;/p&gt;
